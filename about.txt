So, about me.<br>
I'm a student, a programmer, and a gamer.<br>
I'm still in high school, but I'm also at a secondary school for programming.<br>
My programming experience is mostly in <em class="python_color_text">Python</em> and <em class="lua_color_text">Lua/Luau</em> but I'm also attempting <em class="javascript_color_text">JavaScript</em> and <em class="csharp_color_text">C#</em>.<br>
<br>
I'm from Myanmar, but I'm currently living in the United States. Wasn't in Myanmar for that long; kinda moved when I was 2.<br>
For gaming, yeah I do play a variety of games, if you do manage to check my Steam library.<br>
I'm also one of the shameless people who play gacha games, <i class="small_text">cool mild gambling</i>.<br>
<i class="small_text">What can a short asian kid do?</i><br>
<i class="smaller_text">You aleady know I watch anime, albeit very casually.</i><br>
