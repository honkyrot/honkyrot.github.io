    Hello there and welcome to my website! You probably found this through my<a target="_blank" class="email_link" href="https://github.com/honkyrot" id="honkyrot_github_link">&nbsp;Github&nbsp;</a>profile.<br>
    Anyways, I'm Honkyrot or <em>Hong Rot</em>, a programmer hobbyist, and a student.<br>
    This website is a place for me to put my projects and other <i>probably cool(?)</i> stuff.<br>
    Located locally in Fort Wayne, Indiana.<br>
    <br>
    I'm not intending this to be a full-blown portfolio, or even a resume for that matter.<br>
    This is just a funny little personal website I made for fun.<br>
