Hello there and welcome to my website! You probably found this through my <u><a target="_blank" class="honkyrot_github_link" href="https://github.com/honkyrot" id="honkyrot_github_link">Github</a></u> profile.<br>
Anyways, I'm Honkyrot or <em>Hong Rot</em>, a programmer hobbyist and a student.<br>
This website is a place for me to put my projects and other <i>probably cool(?)</i> stuff.<br>
It could also act like a little portfolio of mine.<br>
<i>You can read the page's source in the GitHub repository if you'd like.</i><br>
