<p style="margin-top: 2px;"> 
    I'm Hong, I like to play games, do software development, and tinker with new things.<br>
    I'm just a little guy born from Myanmar residing in the States now;<span title="INDIANA!" style="color: yellow;"> lots of corn here.</span><br>
    I primarily work with Python, C#, Lua, and a little bit of JavaScript.<br>
    Since then, this website is a place for me to put my projects and other stuff.<br>
    Though I am not a front-end web developer, I still try to make this website look good (i think).<br>
    <br>
    I have a deep passion for computers and software related stuff.<br>
    I self-taught myself programming since 2017, and have grown a lot since then.<br>
    In my free time, I like to play a varity of games, watch anime, socialize with my buds, and work on my projects.<br>
    Maybe do a little bit of software engineering.<br>
    <br>
    I am <a class="link_button" target="_blank" href="https://verify.openedg.org/?id=CtyR.n1LQ.pOjd">Python</a> and <a class="link_button" target="_blank" href="https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/18fd3220-a9da-4fff-99de-6920c132f158">Unity</a> certified somehow...<br>
