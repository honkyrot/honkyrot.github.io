So, about me.<br>
I'm a student, a programmer, and a gamer.<br>
I'm still in high school, but I'm also at a secondary school for programming.<br>
My programming experience is mostly in <em class="python_color_text">Python</em> and <em class="lua_color_text">Lua/Luau</em> but I'm also attempting <em class="javascript_color_text">JavaScript</em> and <em class="csharp_color_text">C#</em>.<br>
I'm also using Unity for small game development.<br>
<br>
+personal stuff:<br>
I'm from Myanmar, but I'm currently living in the United States. Wasn't in Myanmar for that long; moved when I was ~2.<br>
For gaming, yeah I do play a variety of games, if you do manage to check my Steam library.<br>
From anything between action, open-world, strategy, RPGs, and even rhythm games. But i'm not really limited to those.<br>
I also enjoy anime, photography, music, and especially flashlights!.<br>
<br>
The theme of the website was based on the Terraria Lantern Festival event.<br>
Though you could think of it as any other festival with lanterns.<br>
<i class="small_text">(The music is NOT mine, it's created by <a target="_blank" class="small_text_underline" href="https://youtube.com/@HeartPlusUp">Heart Plus Up!</a>)</i><br>
<br>
oh and I bought this domain cause I like .dev domains, and I wanted to make a website.<br>
